 ðŸš€ How It Works
###
 1. Document Ingestion
-
 Documents uploaded via web interface, API, or file system monitoring
-
 Automatic format detection and validation
-
 Queue management for batch processing
-
 Duplicate detection and handling
###
 2. OCR & Text Extraction
-
 Multi-engine OCR processing (Mistral OCR + Tesseract)
-
 Quality assessment and confidence scoring
-
 Text cleaning and normalization
-
 Layout preservation for structured documents
###
 3. AI Analysis & Enrichment
-
 Document classification using Gemini/OpenAI models
-
 Named entity recognition and extraction
-
 Key-value pair identification (dates, amounts, parties)
-
 Legal concept tagging and categorization
###
 4. Vector Indexing
-
 Text chunking with overlap for context preservation
-
 Embedding generation using state-of-the-art models
-
 Vector storage in Qdrant with metadata
-
 Index optimization for fast retrieval
###
 5. Search & Retrieval
-
 Natural language query processing
-
 Hybrid search (vector + keyword)
-
 Result ranking and relevance scoring
-
 Context-aware response generation
